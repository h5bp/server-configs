# Expire rules for static content

# No default expire rule. This config mirrors that of apache as outlined in the
# html5-boilerplate .htaccess file. However, nginx applies rules by location,
# the apache rules are defined by type. A concequence of this difference is that
# if you use no file extension in the url and serve html, with apache you get an
# expire time of 0s, with nginx you'd get an expire header of one month in the
# future (if the default expire rule is 1 month). Therefore, do not use a
# default expire rule with nginx unless your site is completely static
